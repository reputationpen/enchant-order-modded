# Minecraft Enchantment Ordering Tool

This web-based tools allows you to find the optimal order for combining enchant books in Modded Minecraft to minimize XP cost.

You can use it here: [https://iamcal.github.io/enchant-order/](https://reputationpen.github.io/enchant-order-modded/)

The tool works by trying every possible combining sequence and calculating the cost of each.
For items with many enchantments, this can mean trying a few million combinations.
The work happens in a background thread (a WebWorker) and the best solution is explained.
